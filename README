 * SIG-Games Workshop
 * 
 * Main Topics: Finite State Machines
 * Sub Topics:  Singleton Design Pattern
 *              State Design Pattern
 * 
 * Purpose: The main goal of this workshop is to introduce finite state 
 *          machines (FSM) and demonstrated how they can be applied in 
 *          the context of games. In the case of this example we use
 *          an FSM to control our goblin lumberjack as he goes on the 
 *          world and attempts to gather wood.
 
 *          As an alternate goal this workshops attempts to introduce
 *          some design patterns along with their implementation and
 *          ussage. 
 *          State Design Pattern: Used in order to create or FSM.
 *          Singlton Design Patter: Used to maintain only one
 *                                  one instance of each state at
 *                                  any point in time. Since all the 
 *                                  state information is held by the 
 *                                  owner of the state there is no
 *                                  need to create new instance of the 
 *                                  states every time.
