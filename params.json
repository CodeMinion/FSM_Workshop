{"name":"FSM workshop","tagline":"Code for finite state machine workshop for SIG-Games. ","body":"# SIG-Games Workshop\r\n  \r\n## Main Topics: Finite State Machines\r\n### Sub Topics:  Singleton Design Pattern, State Design Pattern\r\n  \r\nThe main goal of this workshop is to introduce finite state machines (FSM) and demonstrated how they can be applied in the context of games. In the case of this example we use an FSM to control our goblin lumberjack as he goes on the world and attempts to gather wood.\r\n\r\nAs an alternate goal this workshops attempts to introduce some design patterns along with their implementation and usage. \r\n\r\n*State Design Pattern:* Used in order to create or FSM. \r\n\r\n*Singleton Design Patter:* Used to maintain only one one instance of each state at any point in time. Since all the state information is held by the owner of the state there is no need to create new instance of the states every time.\r\n                                    \r\n   **Author:** Frank E.
